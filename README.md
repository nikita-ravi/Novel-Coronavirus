Analysis of Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset from Kaggle using Python executed on Anaconda Environment. On analysing the dataset it was understood that a lot of preprocessing had to be done in order to retrieve more information. For example, Observation date column was formated by converting to datetime format and columns were grouped depending on the task since there were rows that had NaN values. Since the data was cumulative, .diff() / fillna. methods was used in order to obtain each days data from the said cumulative data.
