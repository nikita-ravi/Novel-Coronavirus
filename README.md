Analysis of Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset from Kaggle using Python executed on Anaconda Environment. On analysing the dataset it was understood that a lot of preprocessing had to be done in order to retrieve more information. For example, dates had to be formated and columns had to be grouped depending on the task since there were NaN values as well. Since the data was cumulative .diff() / fillna. methods were used to obtain each days data.
